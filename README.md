# Python OOP Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles

# Project List
1- Employees System Project: The Employees System Project is a simple Python-based project that showcases the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles (Encapsulation,Composition) , this project provides a basic example of managing employee data and interactions using OOP concepts.

2- Payment System Prroject: The payment system project is a simple Python-based project that showcases the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles(Abstraction, Polymorphism, Composition, Encapsulation, Mixin), This project support multiple payment methods Paypal, Stripe, Crypto. it generate a new id for each transaction, keep a record of all transactions, allow refuns, log every payment(success/failure)

3- Ride Sharing System: The Ride sharing system project is a simple python-based project that showcases the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, This project support allows user to hail ride's, it create driver's and user's, show available ride's it check if rider's are free just like uber system and assign free driver's to user, it also support payment using multiple payment like stripe, paypal and crypto after a succesful ride completion, proccess they payment 

4- Banking Account System: The banking account project is a simple python-based project that showcase the use of all pilars of OOP, this project creates a user who then login to the banking system and it automatically creates 3 types of account for the user's ``(CheckingAccount, FixedDepositAccount and SavingsAccount)`` the user can make deposit and withdrawal on all three account, get all transaction done in all three account.
- SavingsAccount: On SavingsAccount the can save deposit  and calculate the future value of their deposit after a certain years with an interest rate on their intial principle and also the interest earned on the principle deposite using ``Future value of a series of monthly contributions`` to calcuate for both future value and interest earned it also show logs of success and failure of all operation in the account
- Fixed Deposit Account: These work like a fixed deposit account the can deposit money into the account and an interest is being earned on the intial principle at a fixed time period the can also withdraw but the interest on the principle reduce if withdrawal is before maturity,  
  
  - The interest rate starts at 2% before maturity.
  - At maturity, it jumps by 3% (to 5%).
  - After maturity, it increases by 1% each year.
  - Interest can never go over 10%.
    It also calculate the interest earn on the intial principle and show logs of success and failure for all operation's in the account.
- CheckingsAccount: These work like a checking account user's can make make deposit, making withdrawal on their account balance and also make withdrawal using overdraft with a limit on it when the exceeed their limit withdrawal is stopped they can only repay back over draft and make deposit, They can make withdrawal after clearing their over draft debt
